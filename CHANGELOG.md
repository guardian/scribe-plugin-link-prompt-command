# 1.0.0

Adds a transforms key that allows transformations of the link value before validation and after user interactions.

Adds additional tests to define the behaviour of the plugin and therefore the functionality of the plugin is considered no longer in active development.

# 0.4.0

Adds support for telephone number guessing and the `tel` protocol.

Based on a contribution from [Chris Monkman](https://github.com/SgtOddball). Thanks!

# 0.3.1

The plugin now checks whether there are any non-whitespace characters in the supplied link.

# 0.3.0

The plugin will now accept an optional validation rule that allows proposed links to be vetoed. See the README for more information.

# 0.2.0

The plugin will no-longer suggest using http protocol links when the mailto protocol is specified. Thanks [gmoreira](https://github.com/gmoreira)!
